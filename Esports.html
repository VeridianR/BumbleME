        <p>Marcel Kiefer is a well-known driver in the world of Esports.
        In 2018 he finished fifth in the F1 Esports Driver Standings and in 2019, 
        he finished sixth. This included his first race win at Silverstone, 
        showing that the 22-year-old had potential and was worthy of a place on the Red Bull Racing Esports roster.
        The German Esports driver joined the Team for the 2020 season
        and instantly made an impact with competitors and fans alike.
        Marcel is a no-nonsense driver who will battle for every inch
        on the track and is a big team player on and off-track.
        In his first season as a Bull, alongside Frede Rasmussen,
        he was able to help the Red Bull Racing Esports Team regain
        the Teams' Championship in the F1 Esports Pro Series.
        Along the way he also was victorious at the Red Bull Ring,
        along with a further six podiums. He finished third overall
        in the Drivers' Championship.</p>

     <p>Frederik Rasmussen is no stranger to the F1 Esports Series having competed
        in it since it began four years ago.
        The Dane finished sixth overall in 2017,
        and an impressive third in the drivers’
        standings in 2018, racing for sister team AlphaTauri.
        In 2019, he joined Red Bull Racing Esports and continued his fine form.
        Alongside Joni he helped lead the Team to glory, picking up the 2019
        Teams’ Championship, whilst finishing second in the drivers’ standings.
        2020 was another strong year for Frede, finishing runner-up and
        taking three race wins in the 12-race F1 Esports season.
        And with Marcel Kiefer as his teammate, the pair took the
        Teams' Championship title, making Frede a back-to-back champion.</p>
