   <h2>Front Wing</h2> 
    <p> In the hybrid era front wings were an area of huge focus for teams and increasingly complex as teams
    tried to find greater aerodynamic benefits. The front wing was routinely simplified
    in the final years of the last generation of cars, but for 2022 it has been totally
    reimagined. A four-element wing is attached directly to the nose and features a very 
    simple endplate. The idea is that with the floor generating the bulk of downforce,
    the front wing doesn’t have to work as hard and the simplified version will also be less
    sensitive to the turbulent wake from a car in front.</p>

    <div class="backwingbox">
        <h2>Rear Wing</h2>
        <p>
    The rear wing is also vastly different to previous generations.
    The chief goal is to reduce the wake of dirty air behind the car.
    The first step towards this is to get rid of rear wing end plates.
    These are great for generating downforce, but also for generating
    dirty air that disrupts the stability of a following car.
    The new rear wing’s curved shape not only removes endplates,
    but its curved shape also creates an airflow structure that
    collects wake from the rear wheels and funnels it into the
    flow coming up from the rear diffuser, helping to fire the
    lot high into the air, causing less instability for a following car.</p>

    <div class="WingletsAndCovers">
        <h2>Wheel Covers and Winglets</h2>
        <p>A major area of aero development for teams in recent years has
        been using airflow through the wheels to generate downforce and,
        once again, to channel dirty air outboard of the car,
        adding to a turbulent wake that causes instability in a following car.
        To remove that temptation from designers,
        F1 has chosen to implement wheel covers that physically prevent air being channelled through the wheels.
        The new rim covers are tightly defined however, so teams won’t
        get to play with the design to channel that turbulent air.
        The new cars also get a small winglet over the new 18” tyres this season.
        These are designed to help control the wake coming off the front tyres and direct it away from the rear wing.</p>
